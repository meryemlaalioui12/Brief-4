📊 Sales Analysis Dashboard – Excel Project
📌 Overview

The Sales Analysis Dashboard is an interactive Microsoft Excel solution designed to monitor and analyze business performance in a clear and dynamic way. It centralizes key sales indicators and transforms raw data into meaningful insights through structured visualizations and intuitive navigation. The goal of this project is to support data-driven decision-making by providing a comprehensive and user-friendly reporting environment.

🎯 Project Description

This dashboard provides a global view of sales activity, including total revenue, number of units sold, average basket value, and best-performing products. It also evaluates operational metrics such as customer satisfaction rate, return rate, and delivery performance. By combining these indicators, the dashboard offers both strategic and operational visibility into business performance.

Interactive slicers allow users to filter the data by region, product, traffic source, and year. All charts and KPIs update automatically according to the selected filters, enabling deeper and more flexible analysis. The visual components include sales trends over time, product-level comparisons, regional sales distribution, traffic source analysis, revenue breakdown, and delivery performance evaluation.

🚀 Purpose and Value

This project demonstrates strong skills in data visualization, KPI analysis, dashboard design, and Excel-based data modeling. It reflects the ability to transform complex datasets into actionable business insights while maintaining a clean and professional user experience.
